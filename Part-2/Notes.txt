For this project:

	'npm run server' to run the server
	'npm start'	 to run the app

For any new project:

	There should be a db.json file in root with the server contents

	npx create-react-app projectname
	cd projectname
	npm install axios
	on the package.json file, on "scripts", add: "server": "json-server -p3001 --watch db.json"
	npm install json-server --save-dev
	
	Then finally:
	
	npm run server
	npm start

Server will display at port 3001 with the contents of the db.json file

Run two windows at the same time to see server-client comunication. 

	http://localhost:3000 will hold the react app
	http://localhost:3001 will hold the server	
	
	The contents of the server should be nicely shown using the jsonview chorme extension
		Also don't forget to install react devtools chrome extension
